# Eric Popelka's code samples

Welcome! This repository is my digital portfolio, a collection of programming exercises that I am delighted to share with you.

## Contents:

### [oscilloscope-go-server](./oscilloscope-go-server)

An HTTP server that serves up waveform animations, written in Go.
Based on samples from the first chapter of _The Go Programming Language_ by
Donovan and Kernighan, it's an exercise in handling HTTP requests and
generates some interesting images using `ffmpeg`.

Also, check out [rust-people-db](https://github.com/arickp/rust-people-db)
for a simple application that manages a database of people, such as account holders.
