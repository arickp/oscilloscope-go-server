# Eric Popelka's code samples

Welcome! This repository is my digital portfolio; a collection of programming exercises that I am deleted to share with you.

### [oscilloscope-go-server](./oscilloscope-go-server)

An HTTP server that serves up animated GIFs of waveform animations, written in Go.
Based on samples from the first chapter of _The Go Programming Language_ by
Donovan and Kernighan, it's a quick exercise in handling HTTP requests and
generates some interesting images.
