# Eric Popelka's code samples

Welcome! This repository is my digital portfolio, a collection of programming exercises that I am delighted to share with you.

## Contents:

### [oscilloscope-go-server](./oscilloscope-go-server)

An HTTP server that serves up waveform animations, written in Go.
Based on samples from the first chapter of _The Go Programming Language_ by
Donovan and Kernighan, it's an exercise in handling HTTP requests and
generates some interesting images using `ffmpeg`.

### [rust-people-db](./rust-people-db)

A simple Rust CLI tool to manage a database of people stored in a CSV file.
Demonstrates command-line argument parsing, file I/O operations, and data validation
in Rust. Supports adding, editing, deleting, and printing people records with
structured data fields.
